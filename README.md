## Problem Statement

Managing personal finances is a critical aspect of daily life, yet many individuals struggle to keep track of their income and expenses effectively. Traditional methods like paper-based tracking or basic spreadsheets are often:

- **Time-consuming** and prone to human error
- **Difficult to access** from multiple devices
- **Lack proper categorization** and organization
- **Missing validation** leading to inconsistent data entry
- **No user authentication** making data insecure

There was a need for a simple, web-based solution that allows users to:
- Securely manage their personal financial data
- Add, view, update, and delete income and expense records
- Maintain data integrity through proper validation
- Access their information from any device with internet connectivity

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Develop a secure user authentication system** with proper validation
2. **Create an intuitive interface** for managing financial records
3. **Implement CRUD operations** for both income and expenses
4. **Ensure data integrity** through comprehensive validation rules
5. **Provide responsive design** that works across different devices

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Maintain clean code structure** with proper separation of concerns
2. **Implement user-friendly alerts** for better user experience
3. **Create a consistent navigation system** across all pages
4. **Ensure database security** with proper query handling
5. **Provide comprehensive documentation** for future maintenance

## Database Design

### Tables Structure

#### 1. Users Table
**Purpose**: Store user authentication and profile information

| Column | Type | Key |
|--------|------|-----|
| Id | INT | Primary Key |
| name | VARCHAR | - |
| email | VARCHAR | - |
| password | VARCHAR | - |

#### 2. Income Table
**Purpose**: Store user income records

| Column | Type | Key |
|--------|------|-----|
| i_id | INT | Primary Key |
| amount | DECIMAL | - |
| source | VARCHAR | - |
| date | DATE | - |
| user_id | INT | Foreign Key |

#### 3. Expenses Table
**Purpose**: Store user expense records

| Column | Type | Key |
|--------|------|-----|
| e_id | INT | Primary Key |
| amount | DECIMAL | - |
| description | VARCHAR | - |
| category | VARCHAR | - |
| date | DATE | - |
| user_id | INT | Foreign Key |

### Database Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: Users → Income (One user can have multiple income records)
- **One-to-Many**: Users → Expenses (One user can have multiple expense records)
- **Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own records
